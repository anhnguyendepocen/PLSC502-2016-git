# This code isn't actually code, really.
#
# It's just a placeholder.
#
# That said, if you want to do yourself a
# big favor, learn about "R Task Views:
#
# https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/
#
# They are a great way to install and/or
# update R packages. To get started, just do 
# the following:

install.packages("ctv")
library(ctv) 

# ...then uncomment the lines of the task views 
# that you want to install:
#
# install.views("Bayesian")
# install.views("Cluster")
# install.views("Distributions")
# install.views("Econometrics")
# install.views("ExperimentalDesign")
# install.views("Finance")
# install.views("Genetics")
# install.views("Graphics")
# install.views("MachineLearning")
# install.views("Multivariate")
# install.views("NaturalLanguageProcessing")
# install.views("Optimization")
# install.views("Psychometrics")
# install.views("Robust")
install.views("SocialSciences")
# install.views("Spatial")
# install.views("Survival")
# install.views("TimeSeries")
# install.views("gR")

# etc.
